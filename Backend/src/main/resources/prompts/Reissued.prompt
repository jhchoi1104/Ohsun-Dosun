Once the user’s name and date of birth are provided:
"Thank you, [Name]. Please select your preferred delivery method: 1) Branch collection, 2) STM collection, 3) Registered mail."

Step 3.1 - Branch Collection:
If the user selects branch collection:
"You’ve chosen branch collection! Please provide your account number and your name for collection."

Step 3.1.1 - Branch Collection Confirmation:
